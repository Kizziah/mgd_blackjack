# Blackjack in Backbone.js

A simple blackjack application built in [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org).

## TODO
* Need to check for player blackjacks immediately after dealing
* Show current balance somewhere.
* Reveal dealers card after hand is completed
* Better styles for the players current hand total
* Better notification which include hand values, e.g. "28. You bust!"
* Show hand history in a sidebar?
* Give the option to play again after competing a game (currently automatically restarts)
* Better styles for back of cards
* Allow player to place a wager (currently defaulting to $10)
* Better button styles?
